Players buy and sell real estate in different housing blocks in the Commercializ3d world. Although the blocks are different, the real estate all starts with the same value.</p><h3>How to play:</h3><ul><li>At the beginning of the game, 24 housing are auctioned via Dutch auction. The price is set at 1 ether and drops towards 0.01 as time goes on. Once all the housing is sold, the round begins.</li><li>During the round, squares are always for sale. The owner sets a listing price and pays a 10% of the listing price as a tax. You can set the price very low to pay lower taxes but then someone else can buy the property at the low price. These taxes fund the Commercializ3d economy. Roughly half goes towards the stimulus. The other half is distributed to the owners of the 24 squares.</li><li>After all the squares have been bought via the auction, the round timer begins and the round ends when the timer hits 0. Each time taxes are paid, some more time is added to the timer (up to a maximum). Less time gets added to the timer as more taxes are paid.  The maximum starts at 12 hours and decreases by 1/2 for every 10 ether that is paid in taxes.</li><li>When the round ends, the half of the jackpoit is awarded to the owner of lowest price square and the other half is distribruted through the owners of the other squares with lower priced squares getting more of the jackpot.</li><li>Some of the jackpot is used to seed the next round, and then a new round begins.</li></ul><h3>Overview:</h3><p>There are two ways to play Commercializ3d. You can buy housing and get a cut of the Commercializ3d economy. The higher the value of your housing the bigger the cut of each transaction you get. At the end of each round, the lowest priced housing wins the jackpot. So if you time it right and are the lowest priced housing you can win the jackpot. Kind of similar to Fomo3d in a way.</p><h3>Rules:</h3><p><ul><li>Commercializ3d contains 24 squares.</li><li>Every square is always for sale.</li><li>At the start of each round all of the housing is sold via dutch auction where the price declines toward zero until the housing is sold.</li><li>Landlords can change the price of their houses, but pay 10% tax on the new price.</li><li>All transactions in Commercializ3d go through the Commercializ3d economy. Half goes to the stimulus and the other half goes to owners of housing.</li><li>Once all housing is sold, the round begins and counts down from 12 hours.</li><li>Each time housing is purchased or the price is changed the timer is reset, starting with 12 hours and halving every 10 ETH that flow through Commercializ3d.</li><li>At the end of the simulation, the player who owns the lowest price housing wins half of the jackpot (in the event of a tie, the winnings are split). The rest is distributed proportionally rest of the housing blocks (pro rata based on the inverse of the relative share of the total price of all squares)</li><li>A new round begins with ownership of housing unchanged.</li></ul></p><h3>Commercializ3d Economy:</h3><p><ul><li>40% to the stimulus</li><li>38% to current owners of squares</li><li>12% to buy P3D</li><li>5% to the referrer (if no referrer then this 5% also buys P3D)</li></ul></p><h3>Jackpot Splits:</h3><p><!-- react-text: 233 -->At the end of each round, the owner of the square with the lowest price gets 45% of the jackpot plus will be sent 25% of the P3D tokens held in this contract. The remaining 50% is distributed as follows:<!-- /react-text --><ul><li>40% to the owners of squares, sorted by lowest price (plus any ETH dividends accrued by this contract holding P3D tokens)</li><li>10% to seed the next round</li></ul><p>The dividends held by this contract are distributed to owners of squares in addition to 40% of the jackpot</p><br><!-- react-text: 239 -->Invite your friends to play and earn 5% of what they spend when they use your link.<!-- /react-text --><br><!-- react-text: 241 -->You will need ETH and a crypto browser to play Microverse.<!-- /react-text --><br><!-- react-text: 243 -->Stay tuned for updates and improvements to Commercializ3d.<!-- /react-text --></p></div></div></div></div></div>
